Backtracking algorithm
-Pick an empty square and try all numbers
-Find one that works
-Repeat the above steps with the net empty squares
-Backtrack:erase the current wrong value and move to the previous square and try a different number for that square
-Repeat the backtracking until we get a valid solution
